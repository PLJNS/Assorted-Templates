Assorted Templates
==================

Overview
--------

Whenever I write a paper or make a new GitHub repo or submit a programming 
assignment, I forage around my computer for the last time I did that thing 
trying to find the template in LaTeX or the LICENSE or my generic Makefile.

So it was time to formalize the damn things.

You'll likely find the APA and MLA LaTeX files the most useful.

Quick Start
-----------

* Download the template you'd like,
* Fill in the blanks, if there are any,
* Type `latex [path/to/your/file]` in the terminal,
* Enjoy your sweet PDF, hand it in, receive A+, whatever.
