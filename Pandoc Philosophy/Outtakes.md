The purpose of this essay is to undermine arguments which take the explanation of a cognitive phenomena "into the head" with computationalism and representationalism.

> In short, we began to focus less on the outside world that is being put into the brain and more on what brains are doing. --- Freeman and Skarda

The methodology found in "Evolving a neural model of insect path integration" is: (1) to take some cognitive action, (2) characterize it functionally, (3) limit a robotic model to biologically plausible hardware, (4) posit the existence of "cognitive action cells" which operate computationally and representationally. This is a computational and representational approach to cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This is significantly different from the methodology found in "Intelligence without representation", where Brooks builds robots with low-level simple activities and responses that are not ever semantically charged. This methodology is different in that cognitive agents are not taken to be syntax-driven theorem-proving machines, but beings with complex reactions to their environment.

Two notions found in modern cognitive science and philosophy of mind are
those of *representation* and *computation*. The commonsense notion of representation is that a map represents a part of the Earth, an partially filled-in batter icon represents a partially charged battery, and the string "C#" represents a sound-wave at a $138.591$ Hz. The commonsense notion of computation is "information processing", "algorithmic operation", or "mathematical calculation." The Representation Theory of Mind (RTM) is the view that:


\noindent One of the arguments for this view is given by Fodor in that there is a "striking parallelism" between "trains of thought" and "inferences." A train of thought can be understood from the first-person perspective as that sensation of hearing one's inner voice go express statements like, "I want a beer $\to$ There is beer in the fridge $\to$ I should go to the fridge." Inferences are strait forwardly going from premises to conclusions.

"Evolving a neural model of insect path integration"
----------------------------------------------------

Wessnitzer *et al.* (2013) use a genetic algorithm to create a neural model of path integration. Their method models two biologically plausible "sensors and effectors": (1) the dorsal arrays of photoreceptors at the rim of *Cataglyphis fortis*' compound eyes;  and (2) interneurons that receive input from these sensors. The "direction cells" have three neurons each: one memory CTRNN cell and two sigmoid neurons. Based on different strengths of activations, a full
360 degrees can be represented by this neural network.

FP is the theory which everyone uses to navigate social life, like making plans with friends or ordering food from a restaurant.  RTM posits the existence of a Language of Thought (hereafter LOT), an infinite set of mental representations that have semantic properties like content and truth-values, but also physical properties like causal efficacy and spatio-temporal relations. 

To understand how it is that representations gets into psychological explanation, consider Intentional Realism (hereafter IR): Fodor argues that a psychological theory is commonsensical about beliefs and desires if it posits mental states that ...

1. Are *semantically evaluable*: They can be true or false or accurate in inaccurate;
2. Are *causally efficacious*: They are causally involved in producing an organism's behavior; and
3. Align with FP: Commonsense belief/desire psychology is vindicated.
