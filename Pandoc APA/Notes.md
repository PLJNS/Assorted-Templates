Paper for Advanced Topics in Metaphysics Notes
==============================================

"The Anatomy of the Big Bad Bug", Rachael Briggs
------------------------------------------------

### Stage Setting

-   Schism in philosophy of science on nomological properties:
    does the universe "at bottom" contain any laws, 
    dispositions, or objective chances?
    -   Of course the *talk* has these, but is this "theory-laden?"
        -   But can it *in principle* be analyzed away?

    -   The debate about Humean Supervenience is whether nomological
        facts supervene on non-nomological facts.

-   The Big Bad Bug is an argument to the effect that objective chances
    faily to supervene on non-nomological matters of fact.
-   Briggs argues that the Big Bad Bug is a stronger argument than many
    defenders of Humean Supervenience have realized.
-   Her work has the following structure:
    1.  The groundwork for the Bug by explaining HS in more detail.
    2.  State the Bug informally and rephrase it as a formally valid argument.
    3.  Map out possible objections to the Bug's premises, and show
        that none of them work.

#### Humean Supervenience

> *(HS)*: Laws of nature, dispositions, and chances supervene on the distribution
> of categorical properties in the world (past, present, and future).

-   Two clarification remarks:
    1.  The term "categorical" is meant to exclude nomologically loaded properties
        such as dispositions.
    2.  This is different from Lewis' HS.
        -   The difference is in that the properties that subven the laws
            are *local* as well as categorical, intrinsic to point-sized
            regions or particles.

-   HS is crucial to motivation BSA.
    -   BSA is a way of cashing out the idea that laws, dispositions, and chances
        are nothing but regularities in the overall distribution of categorical 
        properties.
    
        > *(BSA)*: Laws of nature are the tehorems of whichever deductive system
        > best summarizes the truth about the past, present, and future distribution
        > of categorical, while balaching the competing theoretical virtues of
        > simplicity, strength, and fit.

        -   Dispositions and chances are defined in terms of BSA.
        -   The BSA is treated as the Bug's primary target.
